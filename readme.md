# 🧠 Data Analysis with Python – freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Analysis with Python** certification course by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

This repository showcases five hands-on projects that demonstrate core data analysis skills using Python. These projects cover statistical computation, data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling – all aligned with real-world analytical workflows.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Each project in this repository is implemented using the following stack:

| Tool                    | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python 3.9+**         | Core programming language                           |
| **Jupyter Lab / Colab** | Interactive development environment                 |
| **Pandas**              | Data wrangling and manipulation                     |
| **NumPy**               | Numerical operations                                |
| **Matplotlib**          | Static data visualization                           |
| **Seaborn**             | Statistical data visualization (used in some cases) |

> 💡 All environments are tested and runnable via Google Colab or local Jupyter Notebook setups.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder below represents an individual certification project. Click through to explore each solution with code, input datasets, and rendered visualizations (where applicable).

### 1. [`mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator`](./mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)

> A NumPy-powered calculator that takes a 3x3 list and returns its **mean**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **max**, **min**, and **sum** along both axes and as a flattened array.

📌 _Concepts covered:_ Matrix operations, axis-based statistics, NumPy fundamentals.

---

### 2. [`demographic-data-analyzer`](./demographic-data-analyzer)

> Performs statistical exploration of adult census data to answer demographic questions, such as the percentage of people with advanced education who earn >50K, average working hours, race distribution, and more.

📌 _Concepts covered:_ Pandas filtering, groupby operations, conditional analysis.

---

### 3. [`medical-data-visualizer`](./medical-data-visualizer)

> Cleans and visualizes patient data to assess health risk profiles. Generates a **categorical plot** and **heatmap** using seaborn/matplotlib.

📌 _Concepts covered:_ Data normalization, outlier filtering, categorical encoding, heatmap generation.

---

### 4. [`page-view-time-series-visualizer`](./page-view-time-series-visualizer)

> Visualizes daily page views over time using **line plots**, **bar charts**, and **box plots** to analyze seasonality and trends in web traffic.

📌 _Concepts covered:_ Time series data handling, datetime parsing, multi-type visualizations.

---

### 5. [`sea-level-predictor`](./sea-level-predictor)

> Uses **SciPy’s linear regression** to model sea level rise based on historic measurements. The result includes predictions up to year **2050**.

📌 _Concepts covered:_ Linear regression, extrapolation, matplotlib line fitting.
